provide a starting point for nodemon under the script section in package.json

Express is our node js framework and our server will run on this framework
Mongoose: it helps us create our model and database in mongodb
dotenv: it will store some important credentials for our server like database name , it's url and its password.
    hence we have to hide it somewhere
Helmet: helps you secure your express app by setting various http headers
Morgan: its a server middleware and gives us various results related to connection
